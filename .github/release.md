#Procedural Grasshopper plugin.
Please find a working example attached to this release or by going to our [demo](https://github.com/procedural-build/demos) repo.

##Installation

We provide the option to install the Procedural Grasshopper plugin through the YAK package manager. To install with YAK, just download and open the [ComputeVWT-DEMO.gh]("https://github.com/procedural-build/demos/blob/master/VWT/ComputeVWT-DEMO.gh?raw=true") file and click install when the package manager opens.
We also have a [video]("https://www.youtube.com/embed/oQU_Uke5368") walking through the process 

### Manual Installation (Not recommended)
If using the YAK package manager doesn't work you can install the package manually by downloading the [ComputeGH.gha](https://github.com/procedural-build/ProceduralCS/blob/2020.9.0/dist/ComputeGH.gha?raw=true) and [ComputeCS.dll](https://github.com/procedural-build/ProceduralCS/blob/2020.9.0/dist/ComputeCS.dll?raw=true) putting them in the Grasshopper Components folder.
 That folder can be found in Edit > Special Folders > Components.
