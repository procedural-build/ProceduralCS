# Functional Components

These are functions that wrap other classes and methods within this library.

The intention is that each function maps directly to a Grasshopper or Dynamo type component.  So that you only need to wrap the component/function with GH/Dynamo boilerplate for passing inputs/outputs.  Otherwise all of the functionality should be contained within the functions here.
